# SelectiveChat
SelectiveChat is a web-based chatting application that requires no account registration or profile creation. Simply a free messaging platform for those without emails or subsequent information to chat amongst themselves. This was made using Django Channels and a Daphne file server. This idea was inspired by a close friend of mine who is homeschooled, and this project is dedicated to her.
